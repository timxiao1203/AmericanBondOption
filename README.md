# AmericanBondOption
A valuation model is presented for pricing an American style call option on the yield of Treasury bond. The payoff is positive if the yield exceeds a predetermined strike level. The model assumes the yield of an American Treasury bond to be a log-normally distributed stochastic process and uses Monte-Carlo simulation to price the deal as a European call option.
